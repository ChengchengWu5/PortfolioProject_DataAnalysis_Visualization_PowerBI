### This project analyzes and visualizes energy consumptions in Power BI. 
- It involves three tables, two of which were added extra colomns by tranforming and combining existing columns to create the primary key so as to create the relationship in the data model.
- It then builds a dashboard with visuals for an overview page and extra pages for energy consumptions in more detail by type. For each detailed page, a table (as a visual) is added, from which the subdataset can be exported directly.
- After that, it creates slices, page navigators, and a button to clear all slices to make the dashboard more user-friendly and interactive.
